message: "Watch should have a contact page. Websites ranging in size and sophistication coming from a \r\nlocal restaurant to your Fortune 500 company, have contact pages.\r\nAt my current startup I have seen a number of requestsâ€¦ \r\nin the pizza delivery guy letting us know he was in the door to potential investors \r\nlooking to communicate in with our management team.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're setting encourage contact page (and finding the traffic volume of your local \r\nrestaurant) would likely not be thinking about how \r\nto manage your contact requests when traffic increases.\r\n\r\nAnd you should.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration setting up automation that alerts support, sales as \r\nwell as other stakeholders inside your company \r\nwhen a contact request comes through. You may create a \r\ndropdown field in an application for types of contact requests.\r\nYou'll be able to create logic for most marketing \r\nautomation platforms that sends email alerts to the appropriate resource in the startup according to the \r\ntype of request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\nI was buried with contact requests as we \r\nlaunched beta. Being a cloud-based product I saw many product support \r\nrequests. So we mapped form submissions on our contact page to make support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should also create redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) don't get lost in just one recipient's inbox.\r\nYou are able to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, or trigger automatic replies to call requests with information that will \r\nsolve their problem. This is perhaps all very easy to set up with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
