message: "Hey just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The text in your \r\ncontent seem to be running off the screen in Chrome. I'm not sure if this is a format issue or \r\nsomething to do with web browser compatibility but I thought I'd post \r\nto let you know. The design look great though!\r\nHope you get the issue solved soon. Cheers"
