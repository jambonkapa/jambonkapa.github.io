message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year \r\nold daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell \r\nto her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to \r\ntell someone!"
