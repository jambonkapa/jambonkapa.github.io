I found a sea shell annd gave it to my 4 year \r\nold daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this iss totally off topic \r\nbut I had to tell someone!"
